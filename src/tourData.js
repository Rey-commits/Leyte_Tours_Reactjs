      "Mahaba Island, as the name implies, it is elongated in shape and one of the beautiful islands in Cuatro Islas. It is an island covered with lush vegetation and beautiful white sand beaches and crystal clear waters. Most of the time, there is a noticeable sandbar parallel to the beach on the eastern side of the island. It also has beautiful rock formations and trees to have a shade when the sun gets too hot. Ask your boatmen to stop for a while on the spot where corals and marine life abounds if you want to go snorkeling."
